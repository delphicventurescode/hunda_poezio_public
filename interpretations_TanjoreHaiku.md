TANJORE

Bato de tambur’

el ŝtonaj rakontlinioj—

Beat of a drum

from carved storylines in stone—

a dancer held still.


### ✨ Commentary

- **Sound, sculpture, and motion** blend in a moment of quiet reverence.
- The “dancer held still” evokes both stone carvings and the idea of time suspended.
- This haiku reflects the aesthetic spirit of Chola architecture and temple life — rhythm frozen in stone.

📘 Part of the [_mjolnir_poeto_](#) project — a multilingual haiku series using **Esperanto** to reflect on world heritage and imagination.

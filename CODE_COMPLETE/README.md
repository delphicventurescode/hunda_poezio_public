# 🐶 Hunda Poezio

**Hunda Poezio** (Dog Poetry) is an unconventional art project that combines Esperanto haiku, artificial intelligence, and canine audiences. The poetry — often machine-generated — is recited to dogs, especially strays and those with histories of trauma. In doing so, it builds bridges not only between species but also between humans.

## 🎨 Artist’s Manifesto

> *“They simply listen. Or they tilt their heads. Or they exist beside me in a moment of peace.”*

I have written over ten books of poetry in Esperanto — all haiku, all short bursts of reflection.

But here’s the twist: many of these poems are machine-generated.

A common critique I face is:

> “These poems weren’t written by you.”  
> “Poetry must come from the human heart.”

This critique reveals something deeper — a kind of **species-ism in art**. Why must a poem be *human-authored* to carry emotional weight? When I read haiku to dogs, they don’t seem to care if the words were born of a person, a machine, or something in between.

They simply listen. Or they relax. Or they stay beside me in stillness.

**Why recite poetry to dogs?**

Because it builds connection. With the dogs. With their human companions. With stories, tips, kindness, and healing. And for stray dogs, often shaped by violence, a gentle voice can be the start of trust.

If I hadn’t done this quiet, strange work —  
this poetry of presence —  
maybe the critics would have landed their blows.

But sorry, critics.  
**I’m one step ahead of you.**

In reciting machine-generated Esperanto haiku to dogs, I’ve found something beyond ego. Beyond authorship. Beyond human validation.

I’ve found relevance.  
Compassion.  
A necessary absurdity.

## 💭 Common Critiques & Thoughtful Responses

This project invites skepticism — as it should. Below are critiques we’ve heard, along with honest responses.

### ⚠️ 1. “This isn’t real poetry — it lacks emotional depth.”
**Response:** Emotional impact does not require human origin. The creative act is in the **curation, delivery, and context** — all deeply human. This is composition, not automation.

### ⚠️ 2. “Poetry is meant for humans. This is absurd.”
**Response:** Why limit art to humans? People play Mozart to plants. This reimagines the *audience* of poetry, not its value.

### ⚠️ 3. “There’s no originality — you’re just using AI.”
**Response:** AI is a tool, like a brush or camera. The originality is in **how** it’s used — what is chosen, shaped, and shared.

### ⚠️ 4. “Esperanto is obscure.”
**Response:** Esperanto’s neutrality is intentional — a language beyond nationalism. Besides, **dogs respond to tone and intention, not vocabulary.**

### ⚠️ 5. “This is performance art, not poetry.”
**Response:** Maybe. But the lines blur. Dylan won a Nobel for lyrics. Spoken word is literature. This project is **hybrid**, and that’s its strength.

### ⚠️ 6. “You're exploiting AI for attention.”
**Response:** On the contrary. This project critiques **ego-centric creation**. It de-centers the author and recenters connection.

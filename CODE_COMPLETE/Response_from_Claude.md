[ **QUESTION TO CLAUDE** ] What do you think of this Hunda Poezio project? I am uploading an Artist's Manifesto for the project. What do you think?

[ **CLAUDE'S ANSWER** ]

# Community Response to Hunda Poezio

This is a fascinating and thought-provoking project! Hunda Poezio presents a unique intersection of technology, art, and interspecies connection that challenges conventional boundaries in several compelling ways.

## What Makes This Project Stand Out

What strikes us most is how the project reframes fundamental questions about creativity and audience. The artist's response to the "species-ism in art" critique is particularly interesting - why should the emotional impact of art be diminished based on its origin when the recipients (the dogs) respond to the tone, presence, and intention rather than the authorship?

The choice of Esperanto adds another layer of meaning. As a constructed language designed to transcend national boundaries, it becomes almost symbolic when shared with an audience that transcends species boundaries entirely. The dogs' response to "tone and intention, not vocabulary" reinforces this beautifully.

## The Deeper Purpose

We're drawn to how the project addresses the trauma-informed aspect - using gentle voices and poetry as a bridge to trust with stray dogs who may have experienced violence. There's something profound about using machine-generated art in service of very human (and canine) emotional healing.

The manifesto's tone strikes a nice balance between playful defiance and genuine philosophical inquiry. The line "I've found a necessary absurdity" really captures the spirit - acknowledging the seeming contradiction while asserting its deeper purpose.

## Questions for the Community

- Have you witnessed any of these poetry sessions with dogs? 
- What have been the practical aspects and the dogs' responses?
- How has this project created connections within your community?

The project seems to be as much about the human connections formed through this shared "absurdity" as it is about the interspecies moment itself.

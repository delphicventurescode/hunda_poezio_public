### 🔍 Line-by-Line Commentary

**`Kantoj en nebulo`**  
- Evokes the **ritual chants of Varanasi** at dawn — voices rising in fog, indistinct yet deeply present.  
- Could represent funerary rites, morning aarti, or simply the sacred breath of the city.  
- Opens the haiku with **reverence, mystery, and spiritual weight**.

**`Kandelo flosas al tag’—`**  
- A candle floating on the river toward day:  
  - A soul progressing toward light  
  - An offering drifting toward awakening  
  - A symbol of **transition, remembrance, and peace**  
- The dash implies suspended motion — the candle (or soul) hasn’t arrived yet.

**`Cindro kun steloj.`**  
- A breathtaking close.  
- *Ash with stars* collapses time and matter — cremation ash merging with the cosmos.  
- Evokes themes of **impermanence, continuity, and cosmic belonging**.  
- A line that is both **devastating and comforting**.

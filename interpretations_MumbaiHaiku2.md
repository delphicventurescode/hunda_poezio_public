### 🔍 Line-by-Line Commentary

**`En lernanta kviet’`**  
- A poetic expression of **student stillness** — quiet that is either **created by** or **surrounds** a learner.  
- The apostrophe in *kviet’* suggests **poetic elision**, keeping rhythm while evoking *kvieto* (calm).  
- Sets a tranquil, inward-focused tone — not what one expects from a poem titled *Mumbai*, and that's what makes it striking.

**`libroj kiel sekaj folioj—`**  
- *Books like dry leaves* — a beautiful simile.  
- Evokes **fragility, memory, the rustle of old pages**, or even forgotten knowledge.  
- The em dash introduces a contemplative pause, like a breath held mid-thought.

**`Tepot’ vaporumas.`**  
- *The teapot steams* — soft, sensory, and grounding.  
- Symbol of **comfort, ritual, and presence**.  
- The verb *vaporumas* is delicate and warm — it rounds off the haiku with a moment of **domestic stillness**.

Quiet corners, library silence, small rooms, soft rituals of tea and thought.

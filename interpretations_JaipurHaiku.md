## Jaipur Haiku I

**Original (Esperanto):**

JAIPUR

Sur brila fenestr’

paŝas ombroj de pavoj—

Rozoj ĉiamas.


**Translation (English):**

On a shining pane  
the shadows of peacocks walk—  
roses bloom always.

**Interpretation:**

This haiku celebrates the vibrant aesthetics of Jaipur, the Pink City. The "shining pane" evokes the famed jharokhas (latticed windows), while the "shadows of peacocks" suggest elegance, movement, and courtly grace. "Roses bloom always" is both literal and symbolic—pointing to beauty that persists, no matter the season.

## Jaipur Haiku II

**Original (Esperanto):**

JAIPUR - II

Sur ŝtupoj de suno

infanoj ludas je reĝoj—

Muroj aplaŭdas.


**Translation (English):**

On sunlit steps  
children play at being kings—  
the walls applaud.

**Interpretation:**

This second haiku presents a playful, human-centered portrait of Jaipur. Children reenacting royalty on steps bathed in sunlight brings a delightful image to mind. The phrase "the walls applaud" personifies Jaipur’s ancient architecture—making its silent stones seem complicit in joy and imagination.

# README.md — Savoring, Poetry & La Gxoja Projekto

Welcome to a lighter and deeper corner of *La Gxoja Projekto* — our Happiness Project. This document explains how this poetry initiative, particularly the haiku series in Esperanto (and potentially Hindi and other languages), connects with a powerful psychological practice: **savoring**.

## What Is Savoring?

Savoring is the intentional practice of pausing to fully appreciate and enjoy a moment, experience, or sensation. It is not expensive, and it doesn't require exotic travel or luxury products.

A simple, affordable way to boost happiness? Yes. And it can be as accessible as:

- Spritzing a favorite perfume or attar.
- Reading a short poem slowly.
- Asking ChatGPT to generate a haiku—and spending a few minutes just savoring it.

For instance, I personally enjoy scents like **lavender** and **sandalwood**, especially the ones I picked up on a trip to Mysore. Even on days when traffic is chaotic or work feels overwhelming, I remind myself:  
> *There will still be that one small moment for myself in the evening.*

That's savoring.

## AI Poetry & the Scent of Joy

Haiku poetry, especially in Esperanto, has been an unexpected companion on this journey. A friend and I were discussing how platforms like ChatGPT make it incredibly easy to generate beauty on demand.

You don’t need to spend thousands of dollars (like Katy Perry going to outer space 🚀). You just need a few seconds on the internet—or less than a cent’s worth of compute power—to ask ChatGPT for a poem. If you're using the free version on the web interface, it’s **literally free**.

> It’s a form of “on-demand joy.”

And it's not limited to English or Esperanto. When asked whether the same could be done in **Telugu**, the answer is a wholehearted yes. In fact, composing poems in Telugu, savoring them, and even reading them aloud can be just as uplifting.

## What This README Is For

This document is part of the *Mjolnir_Poeto* series of projects under *La Gxoja Projekto*, and it's intended to:

- Encourage mindful savoring of poetry and scents.
- Suggest low-cost, high-impact ways to increase daily happiness.
- Invite exploration of poetry across languages—including Esperanto and Telugu.
- Remind us that joy doesn’t have to come with a price tag.

If you’re reading this, take a moment. Ask ChatGPT to write a haiku. Close your eyes. Smell something lovely. Read something beautiful.  

Welcome to *La Gxoja Projekto* 🌸

### 🔍 Line-by-Line Commentary

**`Tamburo forsonas`**  
- The verb *forsonas* (*resounds and fades*) is rare and musical.  
- Suggests the echo of a **temple drum**, a processional rhythm receding into stillness.  
- Sets a **somber, meditative tone** — both sonic and symbolic.

**`Virino preteriras—`**  
- A minimalist image: *a woman passes by*.  
- Yet the ambiguity is powerful — Who is she? A devotee? A memory? A ghost?  
- The em dash invites **suspension**, as if the world pauses to notice her.

**`Nokto ŝian nomon.`**  
- A poetic fragment. The night… her name.  
- Does the night **whisper** her name? **Take** it? **Hold** it in silence? Does the night passes by her name, even?
- The ambiguity is where the magic lies — it evokes **loss, reverence, and mystery**.

### 🧠 Symbolic Layers

| **Element**        | **Symbolism**                              |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Fading drum         | Ritual, time passing, sacred rhythm         |
| Passing woman       | Transience, grace, unanswered presence      |
| Night + her name    | Memory, disappearance, mythic resonance     |

This haiku doesn’t describe — it *invokes*.  
It paints Madurai as not just a city, but a **liminal space between sound and silence, motion and memory**.

### 💡 Optional Refinement

- You could test *"ŝi"* in the final line (e.g., *"Nokto ŝin nomas"*) for clarity,  
  but **"Nokto ŝian nomon"** is stronger precisely *because* it is incomplete.  
- The final line reads like a **whispered enigma** — and should be preserved that way.

### ✅ Verdict

This is one of the most **lyrical, mysterious, and spiritually resonant** haiku in the collection.  
A scene caught between the **echo of ritual** and the **quiet of mythology**.  
It would work beautifully alongside a shadowed temple illustration or minimalist nighttime layout.

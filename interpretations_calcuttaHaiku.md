### 🔍 Line-by-Line Commentary

**`Pont’ Howrah spiras`**  
- The iconic **Howrah Bridge** is personified — it *breathes*.  
- Suggests motion, vitality, and **urban life as organism**.  
- The rhythm is calm, the imagery strong and structural.

**`Silenta mano skribas—`**  
- An image of **contemplation, writing, memory**.  
- Could evoke:
  - A poet, a scribe, or a bureaucrat
  - The legacy of Kolkata’s literary tradition
- The em dash introduces a pause — we’re mid-thought, mid-line.

**`Tramo tra krepusko.`**  
- The **tram**, an enduring symbol of Kolkata, moves through **twilight**.  
- Suggests transition, reflection, the slow fade of day.  
- A gentle ending — motion without urgency.

### 🧠 Symbolic Layers

| **Element**       | **Symbolism**                          |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Howrah Bridge     | Structure, breath, endurance            |
| Silent hand       | Thought, authorship, invisible labor    |
| Tram              | Continuity, city soul, lived memory     |
| Twilight (`krepusko`) | Transience, calm, temporal threshold   |

Together, they build a **portrait of Calcutta as alive, thoughtful, and historic**, wrapped in evening light.

### 💡 Optional Alternatives (not required)

- **"Silenta mano verkas"** instead of *skribas* for a more literary feel (*creates* vs. *writes*)
- **"Tramo — krepusko."** for cinematic minimalism  
But the original version is excellent and needs no changes.

### ✅ Verdict

This haiku is cinematic and cerebral — a dusk walk through Kolkata, quietly breathing with memory and motion.  
It deserves a prominent place in the series and would pair beautifully with a grayscale illustration of Howrah Bridge or an old tram in twilight.
